# Step 4: Creating Digital Ocean App

## Generate requirements file

Only if you are using Poetry to create and manage your virtual environment, you need to run the following command to generate a dependencies file that Digital Ocean supports. If you used `pipenv` then you can skip this step.

```bash
poetry export --format=requirements.txt > requirements.txt
```

## Generate App

First, if you haven't used Digital Ocean yet, [sign up for $100 credit](https://m.do.co/c/47e5e578d1cd) which is good for 60 days.

> Reminder: Deploying your Django app is $5.00 per month after your initial credit is used, or after 60 days has passed.

Visit https://cloud.digitalocean.com/apps and click **Create App**.

You’ll be prompted to connect your GitHub account. Connect your account and allow DigitalOcean to access your repositories. You can then choose to let DigitalOcean have access to all of your repositories or just to the ones you wish to deploy.

Click **Install and Authorize** to return to your DigitalOcean dashboard and continue creating your app.

Under the **Repository** section, choose your project repository from the dropdown menu. Select your `main` branch. Do not enable autoscaling.

Then, click **Next**.

DigitalOcean detects that your project is a Python app and automatically populates a partial run command.

Click the **Edit** pencil icon next to the app.

Then, click **Edit** to the right of the **Run Command** section. Your completed run command needs to reference your project’s WSGI file. Yours will be the name of your capstone project.

Recall that the name of your project is the directory name where `urls.py` and `settings.py` are, not where your models, views, fixtures are. Replace `django_app` in the command below with your project name.

```sh
python manage.py makemigrations {name of your api project}
python manage.py migrate
gunicorn --worker-tmp-dir /dev/shm django_app.wsgi
```

Click **Save** to confirm the change

Click **Edit** button in **Resource Size** section, and choose the $5/month option.

Click **Save** to confirm the change

Then click **Back** at the bottom of the page to return to the Resources page.

Finally, click **Next** to proceed.
