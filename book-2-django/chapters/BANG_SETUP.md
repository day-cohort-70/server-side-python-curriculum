## Getting Started

### 1. Generate your API repository

One teammate needs to follow these instructions. Everyone else wait until it is complete.

1. Pick a team name. Make it simple like a favorite animal or car or mythical creature.
2. [Visit the generation page](https://github.com/new?template_name=bangazon-api&template_owner=nss-group-projects) for the API repository.
3. In the **Owner** dropdown, choose your cohort organization, not your personal account.
4. In the **Repository name** field enter **Bangazon API {team name}**. Do not put curly braces there, just your team name.
5. Click the **Create repository** button and wait for the repository to be created.
6. Follow the steps [to clone an existing repository](https://nashville-software-school.github.io/github-workflow/) and create the `develop` branch.

### Adding your teammates

1. Visit the Github repo and click on **Settings**.
2. Click on **Collaborators** on the left.
3.  Add your teammates.
4.  Share the URL to the repo with your team.

## 2. Joining as a collaborator

Everyone else can now visit the URL and accept the invitation. Then follow the steps in the [clone an existing repository](https://nashville-software-school.github.io/github-workflow/) Github Workflow Guide.

## 3. Generate the client repository

Follow the exact same steps for the client repository. Visit the [generation page](https://github.com/new?template_name=bangazon-client&template_owner=nss-group-projects) to get started.

## 4. Get your backlog the project

Visit the [Github Workflow Guides](https://nashville-software-school.github.io/github-workflow/) for directions on setting up your project board for the API repository. When that step is done, let your instructors know and they will migrate the existing issues tickets so that you can have a backlog.

## Reference content

In this project, you'll be asked to write integration tests. You can read the [integration tests introduction](./TESTING.md) chapter to get started.

You will also be building a small handful of server-side rendered HTML reports.
