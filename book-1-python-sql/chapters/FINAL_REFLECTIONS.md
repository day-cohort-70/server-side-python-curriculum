# Final Reflections on Python and SQL

On the last day of the project, you will review the following questions and record, individually, the observations you have and your current understanding of each topic. Once everyone on the team is finished documenting their responses to the questions, you will review them collaboratively.

On the following Monday, an instructor will join your team before you start the next round of individual learning and answer questions, provide expert guidance and context that you may have about any topic.

## Collaboration

- What high-value service(s) are you providing to your team and your customers when reviewing a teammate's code?
- Why do merge conflicts happen? Can, or should, they be prevented? When should they be resolved?
- When you make a committment for a sprint, what should the team discuss to make sure the tickets are worked on in the right order to ensure that work isn't blocked?

## Full Stack Development

- Imagine that you are given a new feature to build, for example users can subscribe to other users. What is the technical process for implementing that feature? What should be done first, and what should be done last?
- Do you feel that basic operations such as filtering data, joining related data, and ordering data were done by the database, your Python code, or your JavaScript code?
- As a software developer, can you describe what the purpose of an HTTP request is?
- When deciding on the route names to support in your API, what strategy should you follow? Is there a pattern that you have identified?

## Data

- Can you store flat or nested data in a database?
- Can you represent flat or nested data in a JSON request/response?
- In the client side, you used `json-server` as the API application to retrieve data from your `database.json` file.
  - What serves the role of `json-server` now?
  - What serves the role of `database.json` now?

## Patterns and Strategies

- When reviewing a teammate's code, identify some reasons why the code, while it may be working, would need to be removed, changed, moved, etc? Can you think of an example from this project?
