Once you have completed the project, your job is to do a self-assessment. This is truly a self-assessment, as you will need to reflect on what you learned so far.

| #   | üéì Are Your Prepared? | Description |
| --- | ------------------ | --- |
| 1   | [Technical Interview](./chapters/INITIAL_REFLECTIONS.md) | In this interview, we will be discussing your understanding and vocabulary on the technical concepts covered in this book to ensure you are prepared for the group project. |

## üîê Group Project

Once everyone has had their reflections interview with a coach, we will start on a major group project that will span multiple Sprints.

| # | Project&nbsp;Name | Description |
|--|--|--|
|1| [Rare Publishing Platform][28] | Your first, large full-stack group project. You will be building an API service with Python, and using SQL to manage the permanent state in your database. |

| #   | üéì Final Reflections | Description |
| --- | ------------------ | --- |
| 1   | [Python and SQL: Afterparty](./chapters/FINAL_REFLECTIONS.md) | We will be interviewing you after the Sprints _(see below)_ are complete to discuss your growth on general problem solving skills and help you devise strategies for growth. |
